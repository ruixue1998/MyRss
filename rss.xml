&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Over the years, Tesla has built part of its reputation on hosting big, bold events to generate authentic hype for upcoming releases. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690846/tesla-robotaxi-first-reaction-austin"&gt;robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, last week wasn't one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Coverage of the rollout was dominated by a close-knit cohort of Tesla influencers and Elon Musk superfans, many of whom are openly supportive of the CEO's vision. Journalists and tech bloggers who might have been more critical of the technology were not only excluded but also actively ridiculed and mocked by Tesla fans and some of their followers for attempting to ask basic questions about the service. In Austin and online, Tesla fans were taking a cue from Musk, who has spent years fomenting a culture of resentment toward critical media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;One of the more prominent influencers, who goes by Zack on X, claimed he was &lt;a href="https://x.com/blkmdl3/status/1936915343072510091?s=61"&gt;approached multiple times by a Reuters journalist&lt;/a&gt;, whom he promptly ignored. That post, which has over 2,000 likes, received supportive responses from other users - one wrote that the publication and other legacy media outlets "can go F themselves." Another &lt;a href="https://x.com/xenius101/status/1937032094909358356?s=61"&gt;said they would unfollow any account&lt;/a&gt; that simply responded to members of the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Age verification is perhaps the hottest battleground for online speech, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/internet-censorship/686042/supreme-court-fsc-paxton-porn-age-verification-ruling"&gt;the Supreme Court just settled&lt;/a&gt; a pivotal question: does using it to gate adult content violate the First Amendment in the US? For &lt;a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/today/can-texas-limit-citizens-access-to-online-content/"&gt;roughly the past 20 years&lt;/a&gt; the answer has been "yes" - now, as of Friday, it's an unambiguous "no."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1122_3e04.pdf"&gt;Justice Clarence Thomas' opinion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton&lt;/em&gt; is relatively straightforward as Supreme Court rulings go. To summarize, its conclusion is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;States have a valid interest in keeping kids away from pornography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making people prove their ages is a valid strategy to enforce that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet age verification only "incidentally" affects how adults can access protected speech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risks aren't meaningfully different from showing your ID at a liquor store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, the Supreme Court threw out age verification rules repeatedly in the early 2000s, but the internet of 2025 is so different the old reasoning no longer applies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Around this string of logic, you'll find a huge number of objections and unknowns. Many of these were laid out before the decision: &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/five-things-know-about-supreme-court-case-texas-age-verification-law-free-speech"&gt;the Electronic Frontier Foundation has&lt;/a&gt; an overview of the issues, and &lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/age-verification-laws-will-drag-us-back-to-the-dark-ages-of-online-porn/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;404 Media&lt;/em&gt; goes deeper on&lt;/a&gt; the potential  …&lt;/p&gt;
