&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;In May, we learned that the development of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675651/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2-project-orion"&gt;a sequel to the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; game is moving forward&lt;/a&gt; at CD Projekt Red, and today, at the Anime Expo 2025 event, it officially announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249562/more-cyberpunk-is-coming-to-netflix"&gt;new season&lt;/a&gt; of the anime spinoff for Netflix. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/edgerunners"&gt;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will have “…an entirely new story, fresh characters, and a raw, realistic take on the most dangerous city of the dark future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;On Saturday, Netflix released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjhRSNkquOc"&gt;an official teaser trailer for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that mixes up clips from the first season with the message that “David’s Dead,” plus some concept art-style teases as it moves on to a new set of stories in Night City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/GvCqbhZWkAAxTDa_800.jpg?quality=90&amp;#038;strip=all&amp;#038;crop=0,29.057591623037,100,41.884816753927" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" /&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;The new season will be directed by Kai Ikarashi, who also directed episode six in the first season, “Girl on Fire.” There’s no word yet on when &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&lt;/em&gt; will premiere, but they also released this new poster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Showrunner and writer Bartosz Sztybor said &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2503793299"&gt;during Friday’s panel&lt;/a&gt; that for season one, “I just wanted to make the whole world sad… when people are sad, I’m a bit happy,” and that this new 10-episode season will be “…of course, sadder, but it will be also darker, more bloody, and more raw.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51617/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-is-now-in-production"&gt;brief summary&lt;/a&gt; of the follow-up series tells fans what to expect following the end of David’s story in season one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 presents a new standalone 10-episode story from the world of Cyberpunk 2077— a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge. In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 5th:&lt;/strong&gt; Added &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjhRSNkquOc"&gt;teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;The sweeping layoffs announced by Microsoft this week have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697125/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-2025"&gt;especially hard on its gaming studios&lt;/a&gt;, but one Xbox executive has a solution to “help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss”: seek advice from AI chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt"&gt;now-deleted LinkedIn post captured by &lt;em&gt;Aftermath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Xbox Game Studios’ Matt Turnbull said that he would be “remiss in not trying to offer the best advice I can under the circumstances.” The circumstances here being a slew of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs"&gt;game cancellations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697128/warcraft-rumble-maintenance-mode-microsoft-layoffs"&gt;services being shuttered&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697433/romero-games-next-project-has-been-cancelled"&gt;studio closures&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697111/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-user-research-child-safety"&gt;job cuts across key Xbox divisions&lt;/a&gt; as Microsoft lays off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox"&gt;as many as 9,100 employees&lt;/a&gt; across the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Turnbull acknowledged that people have some “strong feelings” about AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot, but suggested that anybody who’s feeling “overwhelmed” could use them to get advice about creating resumes, career planning, and applying for new roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;“These are really challenging times, and if you&amp;#8217;re navigating a layoff or even quietly preparing for one, you&amp;#8217;re not alone and you don&amp;#8217;t have to go it alone,” Turnbull said. “No AI tool is a replacement for your voice or your lived experience. But at a time when mental energy is scarce, these tools can help get you unstuck faster, calmer, and with more clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Microsoft has loudly embraced AI, having announced plans in January to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349798/satya-nadella-on-elons-stargate-accusations-all-i-know-is-im-good-for-my-80-billion"&gt;invest $80 billion into AI infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; prior to this latest wave of job cuts. That environment might have made Turnbull think his recommendations were reasonable. More broadly, however, generative AI is viewed by some creatives as a threat to creative industries like gaming, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009039/video-game-layoffs-2023"&gt;already struggled with growing layoffs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results"&gt;studio closures&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065868/a-dark-shadow-falls-across-the-gaming-industry"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s unclear why Turnbull deleted his LinkedIn post, but if the comments on &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3lt4diia3xc2l"&gt;this repost made to Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; are any indication, creatives probably didn’t take too kindly to his suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;You can read the full text of the deleted post below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;“These are really challenging times, and if you&amp;#8217;re navigating a layoff or even quietly preparing for one, you&amp;#8217;re not alone and you don&amp;#8217;t have to go it alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;I know these types of tools engender strong feelings in people, but I&amp;#8217;d be remiss in not trying to offer the best advice I can under the circumstances. I&amp;#8217;ve been experimenting with ways to use LLM AI tools (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Here are some prompt ideas and use cases that might help if you&amp;#8217;re feeling overwhelmed:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Career Planning Prompts:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&amp;#8220;Act as a career coach. I&amp;#8217;ve been laid off from a [role] in the game industry. Help me build a 30-day plan to regroup, research new roles, and start applying without burning out.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&amp;#8220;What kinds of game industry jobs could I pivot to with experience in [Production/Narrative/LiveOps/etc.]?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Resume &amp;amp; Linkedin Help&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&amp;#8220;Here&amp;#8217;s my current resume. Give me three tailored versions: one for AAA, one for platform/publishing roles, and one for startup/small studio leadership.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&amp;#8220;Rewrite this resume bullet to highlight impact and metrics.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&amp;#8220;Draft a new LinkedIn &amp;#8216;About Me&amp;#8217; section that focuses on my leadership style, shipped titles, and vision for game development.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Networking &amp;amp; Outreach&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&amp;#8220;Draft a friendly message I can send to old coworkers letting them know I&amp;#8217;m exploring new opportunities.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&amp;#8220;Write a warm intro message for reaching out to someone at [studio name] about a job posting.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Emotional Clarity &amp;amp; Confidence&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m struggling with imposter syndrome after being laid off. Can you help me reframe this experience in a way that reminds me what I&amp;#8217;m good at?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;No Al tool is a replacement for your voice or your lived experience. But at a time when mental energy is scarce, these tools can help get you unstuck faster, calmer, and with more clarity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;If this helps, feel free to share with others in your network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Stay kind, stay smart, stay connected.”&lt;/p&gt;
