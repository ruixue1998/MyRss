&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;But two weeks in, I can &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;justify the cost one additional way: the Switch 2 is turning out to be an upgrade for my whole family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;I'm not primarily talking about hand-me-downs, though yes, you could absolutely hand your original Switch down to a kid while basking in the glory of the Switch 2's larger, faster screen. Mom and dad always get the best seats in the house, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;But no: I'm talking about how Nintendo's new features are helping me share the delight of gaming with my 8-year-old kid like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;We bought my daughter a Switch Lite last Christmas, with &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Let's Go Pikachu&lt;/em&gt;, and that's pretty much all she played. All other gaming monopolized the living room TV, where she and her younger sister often clash over what to watch next. &lt;/p&gt;

The track didn't just go viral - it broke the illusion that anyone was in control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;In the scramble to respond, a new category of infrastructure is quietly taking shape that's built not to stop generative music outright, but to make it traceable. Detection systems are being embedded across the entire music pipeline: in the tools used to train models, the platforms where songs are uploaded, the databases that license rights, and the algorithms that shape discovery. The goal isn't just to catch synthetic content after the fact. It's to identify it early, tag it with metadata, and govern how it moves through the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;"If you don't build this stuff into the infrastructure, you're just going to be chasing your tail," says Matt Adell, cofounder of Musical AI. "You can't keep reacting to every new track or model - that doesn't scale. You need infrastructure that works from training through distribution."&lt;/p&gt;

The sprawling courthouse, with an airy atrium in the middle and long, dark halls that spring from it, is where cases involving government agencies often land, and that meant it was hosting two of the most consequential tech cases in the country, all while fielding a flurry of unprecedented lawsuits against President Donald Trump's administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Between mid-April and late May, Judges James Boasberg and Amit Mehta respectively oversaw &lt;em&gt;FTC v. Meta&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;US v.

Over the same period, several DC judges - including Boasberg - had a full docket of cases related to Trump's first 100 days in office, covering the administration's attempt to mass-depor …&lt;/p&gt;

None of these talks progressed to the formal offer stage for various reasons, including disagreements over deal prices and strategy, but together they illustrate how aggressively Zuckerberg has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/687173/inside-mark-zuckerbergs-ai-hiring-spree"&gt;been canvassing the industry&lt;/a&gt; to reboot his AI efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Now, details about the team Zuckerberg is assembling are starting to come into view: SSI co-founder and CEO &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Gross,&lt;/strong&gt; along with ex-Github CEO &lt;strong&gt;Nat Friedman,&lt;/strong&gt; are poised to co-lead the Meta AI assistant.

Wang told his Scale team goodbye last Friday and was in the Meta office on Monday. This week, he has been meeting with top Meta leaders (more on that below) and continuing to recruit for the new AI team Zuckerberg has tasked him with building.
