&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Amazon’s mega sale is nearly upon us. This year, Prime Day will kick off on July 8th and run through July 11th, which, for those counting, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685299/amazon-prime-day-2025-dates-when"&gt;twice as long as previous years&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;As usual, we’ll be here to highlight all the discounts, limited-time promos, and Prime-exclusive deals worth picking up. We’ll also be pulling together any early deals we stumble upon in the run-up to the main event, along with a selection of tips so you can stretch your dollar that much further on robot vacuums, OLED TVs, noise-canceling headphones, and a variety of other &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt;-approved gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;After all, every little bit counts, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none"&gt;I wouldn't have preordered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review"&gt;Nintendo Switch 2&lt;/a&gt; just for myself. The price is high, there's no new &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros. &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;), and I've got a perfectly good original Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck that keep me plenty busy. At first, I could only justify the $450 because I write about gaming tech for &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;But two weeks in, I can &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;justify the cost one additional way: the Switch 2 is turning out to be an upgrade for my whole family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;I'm not primarily talking about hand-me-downs, though yes, you could absolutely hand your original Switch down to a kid while basking in the glory of the Switch 2's larger, faster screen. Mom and dad always get the best seats in the house, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;But no: I'm talking about how Nintendo's new features are helping me share the delight of gaming with my 8-year-old kid like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;We bought my daughter a Switch Lite last Christmas, with &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Let's Go Pikachu&lt;/em&gt;, and that's pretty much all she played. All other gaming monopolized the living room TV, where she and her younger sister often clash over what to watch next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;But two weeks ago, my eldest suddenly realized that we could now magically beam any of my old purch …&lt;/p&gt;
