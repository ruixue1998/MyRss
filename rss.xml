&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Even with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23651507/tiktok-ban-us-news"&gt;TikTok divest-or-ban law&lt;/a&gt; officially in effect since January, the app has only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346961/tiktok-shut-down-banned-in-the-us"&gt;shut down service&lt;/a&gt; in the US for one day. Now, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktok-building-new-version-app-ahead-expected-u-s-sale"&gt;The Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reports that an agreement for a sale satisfying the law’s requirements is close and would come with a new, separate version of the app.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Any deal, however, would need approval from the Chinese government, which is also still wrangling with the Trump administration over tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;The outlet reports that the Trump administration says it’s close to working out a sale to a group of “non-Chinese” investors, including Oracle, with current majority owner ByteDance maintaining a minority stake that would satisfy the terms of the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/815/text#:~:text=DIVISION%20H%2D%2D%20%3C%3CNOTE%3A%20Protecting%20Americans%20from%20Foreign%20Adversary%20%0A%20%20%20%20Controlled%20Applications%20Act.%3E%3E%20PROTECTING%20AMERICANS%20FROM%20FOREIGN%20%0AADVERSARY%20CONTROLLED%20APPLICATIONS%20ACT"&gt;Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;Earlier today, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oracle-gives-u-s-government-discount-on-cloud-and-software-9d893fc4"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reported that the General Services Administration says Oracle has reached a new agreement with the federal government that “is the first of its kind that provides the entire government with a discount on cloud infrastructure,” with a 75 percent discount on licensed software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-none"&gt;TikTok’s staff is reportedly working on a new version of the app — dubbed M2, to the current app’s internal M designation — for release in app stores on September 5th. Trump issued a third &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tiktok/697982/trump-tiktok-ban-apple-google-letters-pam-bondi"&gt;legally questionable&lt;/a&gt; extension of the deadline to ban TikTok from US app stores &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688252/tiktok-ban-trump-extension-deal"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, which is set to expire in mid-September. According to &lt;em&gt;The Information’s &lt;/em&gt;unnamed source, under the current timeline, the original TikTok app would leave app stores as the new one launches and then stop working entirely in March 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at this website, my colleagues and I follow our beats closely, from wearable tech and laptops to influencer culture and federal policy. Last year, I asked a bunch of staff at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24188055/the-verge-summer-in-out-list-trends"&gt;pretend to be trend forecasters&lt;/a&gt; for a lighthearted collection of what's hot and what's not. Some of the predictions really held up: many would say the US Supreme Court continues to be out, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/11/upshot/congestion-pricing.html"&gt;congestion pricing in New York&lt;/a&gt; is decidedly in despite attempts to kill it, and cats are, as ever, a bit of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predicting future trends - and having a pulse on what's happening now - is part art, part science, and, if we're being honest, part wish fulfillment. He …&lt;/p&gt;
